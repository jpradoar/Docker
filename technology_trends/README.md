# technology trend

### My idea
<pre>
I searched some jobs websites, and crawled the "GET" request, after that, 
searched my interest technology and get all words, 
and then I calculate the all repeated words and agroup this in a index.html
finaly I added some tendences to know what the market needs.
I know, this is just an estimate, it's not completely real
</pre>
